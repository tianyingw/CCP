Description: This package provides tools to estimate the parameters of the categorical model, in which a continuous predictor subject to measurement error is categorized. It produces relative risk estimation of what would have been done if the true predictor was observed. The true risk model that applied in this package can be either linear or logistic, and a categorized linear or logistic regression is performed correspondingly.
